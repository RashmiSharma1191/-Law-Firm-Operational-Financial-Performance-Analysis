# Law-Firm-Operational-Financial-Performance-Analysis
---

## 📌 Project Description
This project involved a full-scale analysis of a law firm's operations using five linked data sources (Attorney Details, Time Logs, Billing, Case Data, Client Data). 
Three interactive dashboards were developed to provide a 360° view of firm health across Attorney Productivity, Financial Performance, and Case Management, driving 
data-driven decisions on resource allocation, profitability, and collections.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
1. Optimize Productivity: Analyze billable vs. non-billable time and track attorney utilization for efficient resource allocation.
2. Maximize Profitability: Identify high-value clients and profitable Case Types while monitoring revenue realization and collections.
3. Improve Operations: Track case duration, client volume, and case closing rates to streamline legal workflows.

## ⚙️ Tools & Methodology
| Category | Tool / Technique | Expertise Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Source** | GitHub / CSV / Excel | Sourcing and ingesting external, complex, multi-sheet data structures. |
| **Data Transformation (ETL)** | **Power Query (M Language)** | End-to-end data cleaning, merging, shaping, and transforming the **five separate tables** into a relational model. |
| **Data Modeling** | **DAX & Relationship View** | Creating a star schema, defining relationships, and writing complex measures (e.g., Realization Rate, Firm Utilization %). |
| **Visualization & Reporting** | **Power BI Desktop** | Designing the **Three-Page Interactive Dashboard** (Case, Finance, Productivity) with bookmarks and filters. |

## 📈 Dashboard Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| Dashboard View | Key Metric | Value | Business Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Productivity** | **Firm Utilization %** | **81%** | Indicates high overall workload across the firm. |
| | **Non-Billable Hours** | **242.30** | The volume of time spent on administrative tasks or research that cannot be billed. |
| **Financial** | **Realization Rate %** | **86.5%** | Shows the percentage of revenue successfully collected, highlighting a $37.4K outstanding gap. |
| | **Revenue Variance** | **-143.37K** | Significant deviation, signaling unstable revenue performance MoM. |
| **Case Management** | **Average Case Duration** | **45 Days** | Benchmark for overall efficiency; used to monitor specific Case Type durations (e.g., Criminal is 38 days). |

## 💡 Strategic Insights & Recommendations (Summary)
| Focus Area | Issue Identified | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Collections** | **$37.4K Amount Outstanding** & **86.5% Realization Rate**. | Prioritize collection efforts with top outstanding clients and streamline the billing process. |
| **Efficiency/Cost** | **242.30 Non-Billable Hours** (Research/Drafting). | Implement targeted training for Paralegals/Associates to reduce time on non-billable tasks. |
| **Profitability** | **Real Estate Industry** generates the highest revenue. | Strategically increase marketing/client acquisition efforts toward the high-value Real Estate sector. |
| **Operations** | **IP (50 days)** and **Corporate (48 days)** cases have high average duration. | Investigate these case types to identify and fix procedural bottlenecks and decrease cycle time. |

## 🚀 Future Scope
Potential extensions to integrate predictive and advanced operational analysis:
1. Case Duration Forecasting: Develop a predictive model to estimate the closing time for new cases based on Case_Type and Client_ID history, improving resource scheduling.
2. AR (Accounts Receivable) Risk Scoring: Implement a client scoring model to automatically categorize clients based on their payment history and outstanding balance,
   allowing the firm to proactively manage collection risk.
3. Attorney Time Value: Create a metric to show the Profit Margin per Attorney (Net Revenue after subtracting salary/overhead costs) to identify the true contributors to firm profitability.
